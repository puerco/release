title: Increase the Kubernetes support window to one year

As of Kubernetes 1.19, bugfix support via patch releases for a Kubernetes minor release has increased from 9 months to 1 year.

A survey conducted in early 2019 by the working group (WG) Long Term Support (LTS) showed that a significant subset of Kubernetes end-users fail to upgrade within the previous 9-month support period. 

A yearly support period provides the cushion end-users appear to desire, and is more in harmony with familiar annual planning cycles.
